# DRL vs MVO: Portfolio Allocation Under Market Regimes

This repo is my deep dive into a J.P. Morgan research paper that compares Deep Reinforcement Learning (specifically PPO) with traditional Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) for portfolio allocation. The idea is simple: can a well-trained agent beat classical portfolio theory in real-world backtests?

This project aims to faithfully reproduce the paperâ€™s framework â€” and then extend it in directions that make it more realistic and robust (e.g., transaction cost modeling, regime switching, etc.).

## What Iâ€™m Building

- A custom Gym environment that mimics a portfolio manager allocating across sector ETFs
- A PPO agent trained on 60-day lookbacks, with Differential Sharpe Ratio as the reward
- A fully replicable MVO baseline using PyPortfolioOpt and Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage
- 10-year rolling-window backtesting, multiple seeds per window for robustness
- Proper regime labeling (low vs high vol), evaluation with Sharpe, Calmar, Drawdown, Turnover, and more
- Clean codebase designed to be extensible â€” I want to experiment freely as I go

## Why This?

Iâ€™ve worked on machine learning in finance before, but this time I wanted to go deeper â€” both technically and statistically. This paper by J.P. Morgan hit the sweet spot: well-scoped, rigorous, and practical. Plus, it opens up tons of interesting questions around stability, risk management, and generalization in volatile markets.
